​The Colorado Avalanche delivered a commanding performance in Game 4 of their first-round playoff series, defeating the Dallas Stars 4-0 at Ball Arena on Saturday night. This victory ties the series at 2-2 and showcased the Avalanche's speed and execution, which proved too much for the Stars to handle.​

Avalanche's Speed Overwhelms Stars
From the outset, Colorado's relentless pace set the tone. The Avalanche outshot the Stars 48-23, consistently pressuring Dallas and creating scoring opportunities. Logan O'Connor opened the scoring with a shorthanded goal, followed by a power-play goal from Nathan MacKinnon, highlighting Colorado's special teams' effectiveness. ​

Gabriel Landeskog, returning from a nearly three-year absence due to a knee injury, made a significant impact by scoring his first goal since 2022 and adding an assist. His performance energized the team and the crowd, exemplifying the depth and resilience of the Avalanche roster. ​

Defensive Mastery and Goaltending Excellence
Goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood recorded his first career playoff shutout with 23 saves, anchoring a defense that stifled Dallas's offensive efforts. The Avalanche's defensive unit effectively limited the Stars' scoring chances, maintaining control throughout the game. ​

Looking Ahead
With the series now tied, the momentum shifts as the teams prepare for Game 5 in Dallas on Monday. The Avalanche's display of speed, execution, and depth in Game 4 sets a high bar, and the Stars will need to adjust to counter Colorado's dynamic play.
