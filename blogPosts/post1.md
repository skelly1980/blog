# Learning to Code: Why Slower Is Sometimes Smarter

When it comes to learning how to code, there’s no shortage of advice. Some people say you need a computer science degree. Others swear by intensive coding bootcamps. And while both paths *can* work for some, they often move too quickly for most beginners to truly succeed.

The truth is: **coding takes repetition, not just exposure.**  
If you move too fast, you’re only stacking topics on top of shaky foundations.

## The Problem With Bootcamps and College Courses

Bootcamps and college coding courses often have rigid schedules designed to cover a massive amount of material in a short amount of time. One week you’re learning HTML and CSS — the next, you’re deep into JavaScript frameworks or server-side APIs. Every class introduces something new.

But here’s the catch: **mastery doesn’t happen at that speed.**  
In coding, concepts like functions, loops, objects, and APIs need *real* hands-on practice before they click. If you move onto the next topic before the last one truly sinks in, you’re building your knowledge on an unstable base.

This "move fast" model leads to two major problems:
- **Surface-level understanding:** You know *of* concepts but can't apply them when needed.
- **Frustration and burnout:** You feel lost, discouraged, and overwhelmed — not because you can’t code, but because you weren’t given time to absorb and apply what you learned.

## A Better Approach: Learn at Your Own Pace

Platforms like **Udemy**, **freeCodeCamp**, and **Scrimba**, along with **one-on-one tutoring**, offer a much better learning environment for most people. Why?  
Because you set the pace.  

You can:
- Rewatch lessons as many times as you need.
- Pause when something doesn’t make sense — and *actually* practice it.
- Spend a week (or longer) on a tricky concept like JavaScript promises if you need to — without getting left behind.

If you add **one-on-one tutoring** into the mix, it’s even better. You get personalized help, immediate feedback, and can focus entirely on your specific struggles without worrying about keeping up with a group.

**Repetition and practice** are the real keys to learning how to code.  
Not finishing a checklist of topics.

## Final Thoughts

Coding is not about how *fast* you learn — it’s about how *deeply* you understand each step along the way.  
If you’re just starting out, give yourself permission to go slow. Don’t feel pressured by bootcamp timelines or semester schedules. Choose a path that lets you master the basics at your own pace, with as much repetition as you need.

Because in the world of coding, slow and steady really *does* win the race.
